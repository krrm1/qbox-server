# Community Bridge

Community Bridge is a modular and extensible compatibility layer for FiveM, designed to unify development across major roleplay frameworks. It provides a consistent API that simplifies integration between popular frameworks such as QBCore, ESX, QBox, and custom solutions.

By bridging core game systems including inventory, dispatch, targeting, door locks, vehicle keys, clothing, fuel, and more, Community Bridge reduces duplicated effort and streamlines script compatibility across servers.
